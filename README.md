# Pinger

MacOS app for "pinging" most popular dns servers. It shows the avarage ping (latency), the difference between the minimum and maximum ping and percentage of lost packets. It's written using electron, so it has a rather large size.

Personally, I have this app running all the time, because I want to know if there is a problem with my internet connection when I use my computer.

If you wanna check it out, you may [download](https://github.com/ymatuhin/ping-ping-ping/releases/latest) last release.

## Contribute

Because there is an electron under the hood, there is a possibility to build this app for Linux and Windows. But I have no access to those systems, so your pull requests are very welcome.
